      Visual Studio Code is an integrated development environment made by
      Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.[9] Features include support for
      debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets,
      code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard
      shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional
      functionality. Microsoft has released most of Visual Studio Code's source
      code on GitHub under the permissive MIT License,[5][10] while the releases
      by Microsoft are proprietary freeware.[7] In the Stack Overflow 2021
      Developer Survey, Visual Studio Code was ranked the most popular developer
      environment tool, with 70% of 82,000 respondents reporting that they use
      it.[11] Visual Studio Code was first announced on April 29, 2015, by
      Microsoft at the 2015 Build conference. A preview build was released
      shortly thereafter.[12] On November 18, 2015, the source of Visual Studio
      Code was released under the MIT License, and made available on GitHub.
      Extension support was also announced.[13] On April 14, 2016, Visual Studio
      Code graduated from the public preview stage and was released to the
      Web.[14]

      The system console, computer console, root console, operator's console, or
      simply console is the text entry and display device for system
      administration messages, particularly those from the BIOS or boot loader,
      the kernel, from the init system and from the system logger. It is a
      physical device consisting of a keyboard and a screen, and traditionally
      is a text terminal, but may also be a graphical terminal. System consoles
      are generalized to computer terminals, which are abstracted respectively
      by virtual consoles and terminal emulators. Today communication with
      system consoles is generally done abstractly, via the standard streams
      (stdin, stdout, and stderr), but there may be system-specific interfaces,
      for example those used by the system kernel.[1][better source needed]
